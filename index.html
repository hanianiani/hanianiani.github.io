    <p>Tim Buckley is the shit. You know what makes an epic singer? Epic ears. Everybody has a good voice.
     But the inner hearing controls it. And, of course, some training. Hm, no, actually, lots of training. 
     Even with the shitloads of raw talent that Timmy had he worked on improving his skills a lot. 
     At least that's what says his main guitar man Lee Underwood in Blue Melody.
     Anyways, he always improvised in his live performances and never sang a wrong note. 
     People say this song is about heroin but I don't know what it's about. I've listened to it at least a thousand times (not exaggerating) within the last 10+ years and I just imagined a pleasant street where different emotions and images take over your senses and imagination as you walk it down. Pretty accurate description of the path I'm walking down my life. :D
     But, well, who cares? It gets you high just by itself. </p>
