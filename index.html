    <p>Tim Buckley is the shit. You know what makes an epic singer? Epic ears. Everybody has a good voice. <br></br>
But the inner hearing controls it. And, of course, some training. But Timmy had shitloads of raw talent. <br></br>
He always improvised in his live performances and never sang a wrong note. This song, I've heard, is about heroin. <br></br>
But, well, who cares? It gets you high just by itself. </p>
